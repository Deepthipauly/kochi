        Kochi (also known as Cochin) is a city in southwest India's coastal
        Kerala state. It has been a port since 1341, when a flood carved out its
        harbor and opened it to Arab, Chinese and European merchants. Sites
        reflecting those influences include Fort Kochi, a settlement with tiled
        colonial bungalows and diverse houses of worship. Cantilevered Chinese
        fishing nets, typical of Kochi, have been in use for centuries
